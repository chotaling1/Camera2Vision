# Camera2Vision SDK

This is a standalone Android library forked from https://github.com/EzequielAdrianM/Camera2Vision that also adds additional functionality. You will be able to build the SDK and drop it into your own application. See the sample app in the project for an example on how to use. This sample will let you use the basic functionalities of both Camera1 API and Camera2 API, but with a Google Vision Face Detector added. bYou will get all the power of Google Vision Services on your Camera1/Camera2 application.

## Pre-requisites

* Android SDK 25 (or higher)
* Android Build Tools v25.0.2 (or higher)
* Android Support Repository
